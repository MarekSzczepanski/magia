## Stack Used
React + Gatsby, Styled Components, ESLint + Prettier, Wordpress, GraphQL, Headless CMS

#### React:
I used React because it's popular and it's my favourite tool to make SPAs.

##### Some of single Page Application (SPA) advantages useful for this app:
* High speed
* No page refresh during step change
* Wonderful state management
* Overall development comfort

#### Gatsby:
GatsbyJS is utilized for building fast and performant websites, leveraging a static site generation approach to enhance performance and SEO. With its foundation on React and integration of GraphQL for efficient data management, Gatsby offers a developer-friendly experience.
#### Styled Components
Styled Components is a popular CSS-in-JS library used for styling React components by allowing developers to write actual CSS code within JavaScript files. It enables the creation of dynamic and scoped styles, promoting better encapsulation and reusability of styles in React applications. The library's approach of combining styles and components in a single file simplifies the styling process and enhances the maintainability of code.
#### Wordpress
Using WordPress as a headless CMS provides a seamless content creation experience through its intuitive interface, while allowing developers to leverage modern frontend technologies for enhanced website performance. The extensive plugin ecosystem and SEO-friendly nature of WordPress contribute to building feature-rich, optimized websites. With its robust user authentication and permission management, coupled with a large and supportive community, WordPress as a headless CMS offers a powerful and cost-effective solution for content-driven applications.
#### GraphQL
GraphQL serves as an effective headless CMS by providing a single, flexible endpoint for streamlined data retrieval, reducing the need for multiple API calls. Its introspective schema enables clients to specify precisely the data they require, optimizing network efficiency. Additionally, GraphQL fosters a more collaborative development process, as frontend teams can iterate on their data requirements independently, resulting in a more tailored and efficient content management system.
#### ESLint:
ESLint helps to write consistent and error-free code. It can be used to enforce coding style rules, detect potential errors, and improve the readability of the code.
##### Prettier:
Prettier is a code formatter that helps in establishing consistent code. It's very handy together with ESLint.
